// Pgwire protocol versions are represented as 32-bit integers, where the
// high 16 bits represent the major version and the low 16 bits represent the
// minor version.
//
// There have only been three released protocol versions, v1.0, v2.0, and v3.0.
// The protocol changes very infrequently: the most recent protocol version,
// v3.0, was released with Postgres v7.4 in 2003.
//
// Somewhat unfortunately, the protocol overloads the version field to indicate
// special types of connections, namely, SSL connections and cancellation
// connections. These pseudo-versions were constructed to avoid ever matching
// a true protocol version.
